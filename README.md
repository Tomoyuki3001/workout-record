# Workout Tracking application (MERN)

This is a Workout Tracking application that is used by React, Node, Express, and MongoDB. There are a lot of similar websites and applications, but I wanted to create a simpler version that is without excessive functionality because I didnâ€™t want to see any advertisements, tutorial videos, and pre-set workout menus. Users can record the weight training and cardio training, edit each log, delete unnecessary logs, and update their profile information as other applications.
